            The identity of a village is strongly influenced by its environment and history, which
            in turn shape the village&apos;s structure and architectural style. The architecture of the houses in the
            village is influenced by factors such as climate, locally available building materials, cultural and
            historical
            heritage, and economic influences. The village has an identity that connects it with the surrounding
            landscape,
            and this connection gives rise to the overall appearance and aesthetic quality of the village.<br>
            Only in recent decades have humans had the ability to overcome the constraints of locality. Knowledge and
            materials are now globally accessible, and traditional construction methods can be replaced by industrial
            production. There is no longer a necessity to design the village structure based on climate and local needs.
            However, this progress has resulted in a loss of identity for traditional settlements, and the aesthetic
            quality
            and livability of public spaces have been compromised.<br>
            This negative trend can only be halted by embracing the principles of vernacular architecture. The first
            step is
            to develop a sense of the place, its history, and its identity, in order to analyze what defines the village
            and
            its structure. Directing attention to the landscape and the village is essential before focusing on
            individual
            houses as projects. Only by doing so can a house be created that harmoniously fits within the village, as
            each
            house plays a crucial role in shaping the overall character of the village.<br>
            In the Saargau region, where our house is located, the &quot;Trierer Einhaus&quot; is a typical traditional
            farmhouse and serves as our inspiration for this project. It features an elongated form, with the living
            house,
            stable, and barn are aligned. The region was influenced by the Romans, and as a result, the Trierer Einhaus
            exhibits a clear geometric order in its floor plan and facade.<br>
            Our aim for this project is to create a modern interpretation of the Trierer Einhaus that blends seamlessly
            into
            the village and landscape. Vernacular architecture does not mean sticking to traditions. Instead, it
            involves
            finding the essence of the place while make use of the possibilities offered by the technology of our
            time.<br>
            The site for our project is situated between two big farm houses, built in the 19th-century. Our house is
            intended to complement this ensemble and resemble a barn. The living barn is designed as a double house,
            with a
            corrugated metal facade.
